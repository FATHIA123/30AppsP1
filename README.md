# 30 Apps Challenge Project 1

The CSS Grid | Flex-box App is an App I built to have a better undertanding of how Flex-box & CSS Grid works. This App is using Grid within a flex-box and another grid. I had a lot of fun building this. There is no actual content in this app. It's simply a css app that's mobile responsive !!!
